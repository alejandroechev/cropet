## Post 1: r/agriculture

**Title:** I built a free browser-based evapotranspiration calculator — FAO-56 Penman-Monteith, no install needed

**Body:**

Built a free web app for computing reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method. Enter your weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, sunshine hours) and location (latitude, elevation), and it computes daily or monthly ETo.

Handles all the intermediate calculations — saturation vapor pressure, slope of VP curve, extraterrestrial radiation, psychrometric constant. Follows FAO Irrigation & Drainage Paper 56 exactly.

No CROPWAT install, no spreadsheets, no account. Open source.

Would love feedback from agronomists and irrigation engineers — what would make this practical for your planning?

## Post 2: r/irrigation

**Title:** Free Penman-Monteith ETo calculator — FAO-56 method in your browser

**Body:**

I built a free browser-based tool for computing reference evapotranspiration using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation. Just enter weather parameters and location — it handles solar radiation estimation, psychrometric calcs, and gives you daily/monthly ETo.

No software to install, no account needed. Validated against FAO-56 worked examples.

What features would irrigation designers need? Crop coefficients? Multi-station comparison? Let me know.

## Post 3: r/hydrology

**Title:** Free FAO-56 Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration calculator — browser-based, open source

**Body:**

Built a free web tool for FAO-56 Penman-Monteith reference ET computation. Handles all the psychrometric and radiation sub-calculations from the FAO paper. Daily and monthly ETo from basic weather data.

No install, no login, runs client-side. Open source.
