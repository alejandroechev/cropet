**Title:** I built a free browser-based evapotranspiration calculator — FAO-56 Penman-Monteith, no install needed

**Body:**

Built a free web app for computing reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method. Enter your weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, sunshine hours) and location (latitude, elevation), and it computes daily or monthly ETo.

Handles all the intermediate calculations — saturation vapor pressure, slope of VP curve, extraterrestrial radiation, psychrometric constant. Follows FAO Irrigation & Drainage Paper 56 exactly.

Open source and runs in the browser with no install required.

Would love feedback from agronomists and irrigation engineers — what would make this practical for your planning?

## Post 2: r/irrigation

**Title:** Free Penman-Monteith ETo calculator — FAO-56 method in your browser

**Body:**

I built a free browser-based tool for computing reference evapotranspiration using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation. Just enter weather parameters and location — it handles solar radiation estimation, psychrometric calcs, and gives you daily/monthly ETo.

No software to install, no account needed. Validated against FAO-56 worked examples.

What features would irrigation designers need? Crop coefficients? Multi-station comparison? Let me know.

## Post 3: r/hydrology

**Title:** Free FAO-56 Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration calculator — browser-based, open source

**Body:**

Built a free web tool for FAO-56 Penman-Monteith reference ET computation. Handles all the psychrometric and radiation sub-calculations from the FAO paper. Daily and monthly ETo from basic weather data.

No install, no login, runs client-side. Open source.

Feedback welcome from hydrologists and water resources engineers — what would you add?

## Updated Post Footer (add to all posts)

> **A note on this project:** I'm a software engineer exploring what happens when you use AI to build professional tools in domains you're not an expert in. I've built 14 of these so far — across civil engineering, life sciences, optics, and petroleum engineering — and I'm documenting the journey.
>
> The biggest lesson: AI makes coding easy, but **domain expertise is irreplaceable.** These tools work, but they'd be *much* better if built by someone who actually works in this field. If you're a practitioner frustrated by expensive legacy tools, you might be surprised what you can build with AI now.
